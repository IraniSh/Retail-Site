# Full-Stack Retail Site

Welcome to this simple retail application. Vue.js is used to build a simple front end; Node.js and MongoDB used to construct the back end; Used Axios to communicate between the front and back ends; and added authentication with Firebase Authentication.

## Technologies Used
